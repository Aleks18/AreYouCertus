<p id="aboutp">Hi there, I'm glad you could join us.
<br/> Seriously. I mean it, REALLY seriously. <br/>
<br/>
This website has been created to inform about the <br/>
 good, bad and hidden ways in which our brain works. <br/>
 Sometimes we are shocked at the abhorrent things <br/>
 people do, sometimes surprised at how complex problems <br/>
 we can solve and more often how easily it can be tricked. <br/> 
 <br/>
We will try to cover all these things, and see what <br/> 
triggers good behaviour from evil. 
<br/> Hopefully you can join and discover more about yourself, <br/>
 to see the world through more objective lens. </p>
