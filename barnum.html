<h4 id="bigheadline">Barnum Effect: Why your future isn't written in the stars</h4>
<img src="zodiac.jpg" id="zodiac" align="left"/>
<p id="firstparagraph" align="justify">Since the beginning of the human race we have been fascinated by the night sky, with its magical aura of beautiful celestial bodies we deeply associate ourselves with. Indeed, without the spectacular explosions at the end of the star&#39;s life cycle known as supernovae, we would not be here as the elements with heavier mass than iron, so vital to us, would not be created.<br/><br/>
It is no surprise that roots of astrology reach as far as 18th century BC with the rise of Babylon, most famous city of Mesopotamia located in modern-day Iraq. Babylonians are thought to be the creators of astrology, which laid foundations for Greek and Roman astrology developed at later date.<br/><br/> 
Zodiac (meaning &quot;circle of animals&quot;) is a circle of twelve 30 degree divisions of celestial longitude that are centered upon the ecliptic - the path of the sun. It is also associated with Babylonians (likely around 7th century BC) however, some of the constellations can be traced as far back as 1000 BC including constellations of The Twins and The Crab. They are now used by your Aunt Margery to persuade you to split up with your partner because obviously, as a Scorpio and Aries you might as well not bother, since you are both ruled by Mars and apparently because of that your fate is already sealed. 
We can keep going into all other branches and times that the zodiac was modified, how important it became to certain religions but lets now concentrate on the present; and to look closely at how misleading the interpretations of such creations can mislead even the most certain of us. It is known as Barnum effect, on skepdic.com defined as &quot;name given to a type of subjective validation in which a person finds personal meaning in statements that could apply to many people&quot;. An experiment was designed in 1948 by psychologist Bertram R. Forer.  He gave psychology test to his group of psychology students and promised a comprehensive sketch of their personality based on their results. What happened later was quite extraordinary.<br/>
<br/><br/>

What Forer had produced was single sketch for all students containing 13 descriptions as follows:<br/>
<br/><em>
1.	You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.<br/>

<br/>
2.	You have a tendency to be critical of yourself.<br/>
<br/>
3.	You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage.<br/>
<br/>
4.	While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them.<br/>
<br/>
5.	Your sexual adjustment has presented problems for you.<br/>
<br/>
6.	Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside.<br/>
<br/>
7.	At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
8.	You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations.<br/>
<br/>
9.	You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof.<br/>
<br/>
10.	You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.<br/>
<br/>
11.	At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved.<br/>
<br/>
12.	Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
13.	Security is one of your major goals in life.<br/><br/></em>
<br/>

He then asked the students to rate descriptions from 0 (very poor) to 5 (very accurate) based on how well the description matched them.  The average was found to be 4.26! The amazing part is that the students were not told that they have received the same sketch, making them believe it was all personal.
This experiment was reproduced many times and the results were consistent when statements were vague. What this means is that phrases  like &quot;at times&quot; and &quot;some of your&quot; can apply to almost anyone, and it is us that assign specific situations to such descriptions making them seem very personal. </p><br/></br/>
